# Tank-Trouble-2

This project is still in progress.

[My previous project](https://github.com/shashankanandkannan/Tank-Trouble) didn't live up to my expectations, so I decided to start again, but in 3D. I'm starting by building my own graphics engine from scratch using LWJGL. The end goal for this project is to re-create one of my favourite flash games (found [here](https://tanktrouble.com)â€”I've named this project after it), but prettier and with extra game mechanics resulting from the existence of the z dimension.
